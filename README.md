# govtech-assignment

Simple REST API with a single `/user` endpoint. Built on top of Spring Boot framework utilising the following starters and dependencies:
1. Spring Data REST to serve Hypermedia driven RESTful endpoints
2. Embedded mongoDB to store data transiently
3. Opencsv to parse CSV data

## Acceptance Criteria Instructions

To read and serve user data from CSV, paste the csv data into the `users.csv` file at `src/main/resources/users.csv`
### Acceptance Criteria 2
To output valid users with valid salary within range (0 <= salary <= 4000), use the following endpoint:
http://localhost:8080/users/search/findBySalaryBetweenInclusive?from=0&to=4000

## Additional Notes
1. Aside from the above specified APIs, other APIs provided by Spring Data REST are available
 as [listed here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources)
 [and here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#paging-and-sorting).
 These include `?page`, `?size`, and `?sort` to paginate, limit and sort results.
   - To limit page size to 1: http://localhost:8080/users?size=1
   - To get 2nd page with page size 1 (0-based): http://localhost:8080/users?size=1&page=1
   - To sort results by name in descending order: http://localhost:8080/users?sort=name,desc
2. The application is pre-populated with the example data in the `users.csv` file
